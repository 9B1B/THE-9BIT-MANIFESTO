# THE 9BIT MANIFESTO
I have a dream that one day all nations will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 
"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all bytes should be created with 9 bits."

At the moment we dont really know yet what to do with it, but we are sure there will be an option to use the 9th bit!
Humanity will rise to a new age of honor and dignity, because it opens new possibilities to everyone on our loved planet earth!
Number nine opens a whole new world!
For example we could set a gender for every Byte on your computer or we could mark Bytes as a subject of the legal rights of the copy right holder!
How cool is that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Because were too busy, we decided to discuss the technical possibilities of adding a bit afterwards, 
but we as a group of free and mentally healthy people are convinced that this is the greatest event in 3 million years of human history!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
